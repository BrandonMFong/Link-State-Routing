# Link-State-Routing
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

This repository implements Dijkstra's algorithm in c++.  Provided with a graph and prior implementation of the network in the code, this program runs the algorithm to find the shortest path from point A to point B.
